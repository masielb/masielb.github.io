Responsive Portfolio

To kick off my responsive portfolio I set up three pages according to the homework guidelines, "About Me," "Portfolio" and "Contact." I decided to go with a matching navbar and footer that appear exactly the same across all pages. I also utilized Bootstrap's grid model and Bootstrap components to improve the responsiveness of my layouts. This enabled me to keep my media queries very minimal. 

While I did reference the Assets/Images folder, I also consulted various other portfolio's for inspiration. Some of the major features I followed from the sample images were the following. In the index.html file, I made a card with an image of myself and some descriptive text. Moving forward, I would like to create a Home page in this file and create a separate about.html file. However, for the purposes of this assignment I have just started with a simple card on this page that I can easily move at a later date. 

In the portfolio.html file, I created a similar grid with a title. I decided to make things a little fancier by not simply making lables, but instead, having a label appear when you hover on the image. Moving forward, I would like to make each image a link that leads to a separate page where I go more in depth on each project. Also, in the navbar I added a split button with a dropdown menu for this page so that a user can go directly into a project instead of having to move from Home>Portfolio>Project. 

Finally, in the contact.html file, I mirrored a lot of the components present in the sample image. However, in attempt to be more accessible, my footer includes three social media links with a little spin feature. These actually lead to my LinkedIn profile, my email, and my CodePen account.

Creating this porfolio was a fun and challenging task, however, I am looking forward to adding more! It really helped me practice committing early and frequently. I also feel more knowledgable of Bootstrap's capabilities.
